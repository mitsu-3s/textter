- This application is still under development, and due to security and incomplete source code, we recommend that you do not use this application as a reference, but rather refer to the various documents available in the world.  
- This program is inadequate and not complete, but in case you want to use it, please let me know (no copyright quantity, etc., but I would like to figure it out).
